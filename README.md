## DA5020 Final Project


### Project Overview

For my final project, I chose to curate a database of protein-specific information acquired from the UniProt Knowledge Base (UniProtKB, https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=reviewed:yes). I wanted the R script to read in a list of UniProt IDs from a CSV file and output R and SQL dataframes containing relevant information corresponding to each UniProt entry, including molecular function, biological process, Reactome pathway, and disease involvement. This involves querying the UniProt webpage for each ID using rvest, cleaning the data within R using dplyr, and organizing the data into a SQL database with normalized tables using sqldf.  

My motivation for this project comes from my work as a Research Technician in the lab of Dr. Brad Hyman at Massachusetts General Hospital. Researchers in the lab recently completed a long-term study collecting plasma samples from cognitively impaired patients, from which protein expression was measured for 414 proteins over time. I joined this project over the summer and have been involved in analyzing the resulting dataset, both statistically and visually, with the goal of identifying biomarkers that either predict or correlate with cognitive decline. I realized it would be tremendously helpful to have functional information about each protein in addition to the expression data, in order to potentially identify overarching trends in protein networks.Hopefully, the  SQL database created in this project will provide further insight into the relationship between protein expression change and cognitive decline going forward.  

### Background

The project at MGH involves longitudinal measurement of protein expression in plasma obtained over several years from patients with varying severity of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). This particular study analyzed plasma samples collected at either two or three time points per patient, with approximately one year in between blood draws. Briefly, protein expression was measured in plasma samples using a highly-sensitive transcription-based amplification technology from Olink Proteomics, yielding normalized relative protein expression values for each plasma sample. In total, for 414 proteins and 123 subjects with plasma from multiple time points (2 or 3), this generated 145,314 unique data points.  

Multiple groups in the lab are analyzing the resulting dataset with different goals, analyzing different subsets of the 414 total proteins assayed. My group is particularly interested in the interplay between cerebral vasculature changes and AD pathogenesis and progression. As such, we have been focusing on a smaller subset of 21 vasculature-related proteins. I came across the R package for Time-course Gene Set Analysis (TcGSA) which is designed to analyze longitundinal RNA-Seq data by grouping individual genes into gene sets *a priori* which are known to share common biological functions and/or expression patterns. While this package didn't work with the protein expression data in my hands, it inspired me to approach this longitudinal data analysis from a similar perspective.

### Project Data
For in-depth explanation of the data scraping and cleaning process, please refer to the Project_Writeup.pdf included in this project. In brief, all cleaned data pertaining to the 414 proteins included in this study are included in the CSV Files folder of this project. All data can be re-created using the Project_Code.R script, and the R environment data can be loaded with Project_Data.RData. The Project_Writeup.pdf file was created by knitting Project_Writeup.RMD to PDF using RStudio.

In total, I have compiled twelve distinct data tables that encompass protein function, cellular location, and protein pathways for the 414 proteins in our study. More specifically, I have amassed the following distinct counts of values across the respective tables:  

* Biological Process, Keywords: 81
* Biological Process, Full: 2825
* Cellular Compartment, Full: 335
* Disease Associations: 200
* Function overview: 1763
* Molecular Function, Keywords: 67
* Molecular Function, Full: 580
* Subcellular Location: 41
* Reactome Pathway: 583
* Tissue Specificity: 638
* KEGG IDs: 414

As described, the purpose for this project is to obtain more information about the proteins studied in the longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease plasma study so that we can examine trends among protein pathways and across functional domains. While I cannot share any of the actual data or analysis for this project due to confidentiality, I am excited about how these datasets will facilitate new discoveries for our project going forward. I have thus far only focused on acquiring and organizing the data, as per the project guidelines, but the next phase of project implementation will be to perform statistical analyses (e.g. T-Tests, Logistic Regression, PCA) with biological process and Reactome pathway as categorical variables.
